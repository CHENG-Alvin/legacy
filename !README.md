## API
I made a custom API with node to serve chill&chat and you can download it in the project which is available in the backend folder and you can read the documentation(DEPRECATED) in ./backend/api/APIDocumentation.md for a detailed description.

Please note: I WILL NOT SHARE THE API LINK TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU WANT TO USE IT PLEASE MAKE SURE TO DEPLOY IT YOURSELF.
